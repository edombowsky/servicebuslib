## A Scala library for the Azure Service Bus Java version 2.0.0

- Reference <https://github.com/azure/azure-service-bus-java>
- contains adaptors for:
    + IMessages
    + Sending to Topics
    + Sending to Queues
    + Receiving IMessages from Queues

Currently I use `sbt publishLocal` to use it. May become more formal once things have been re-factored such that it is better ready for others to use.
